# CLASSIFYING 2020 PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE SPEECHES WITH RECURRENT AND CONVOLUTIONAL NEURAL NETWORKS
A Natural Language Processing Project that explores the classification of political speech through RNNs and CNNs.

From the abstract:

> For the final project of LIGN 167, I built a recurrent neural network (RNN) using a gated recurrentunit (GRU) architecture and a convolutional neural network (CNN). I used these networks to classifypresidential candidate speeches in the 2020 election. I built and trained the models in the PyTorchframework and found that the RNN had an accuracy of 47.347% while the CNN had an accuracy of33.311%, significantly beating out the baseline model.

This was a final project for LIGN 167: Natural Language Processing at UC San Diego which received an A.
